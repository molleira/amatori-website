## Amatori Website

![Demo](demo/demo.gif)

This is a simple and minimalistic but beautiful website to showcase the music releases from the Amatori collective. It has a brief description of the collective followed by embedded players from Bandcamp and a contact section.

Please click [this link](http://amatori.net/) to visit the website.

### About
The project has been created with **HTML** and **CSS** only. I have used *semantic* tagging and I have tried to make it *accessible* to as many visitors as possible.

The styleshhet have *comments* to make it easy to understand and I have not used preprocessors, so you can edit the code directly.

### Development
In the future I intend to use *variables* as well as the *BEM* (Block Element Modifier) system for naming classes in order to improve the styles. I also have the goal to make the code *DRY*er so it becomes easier to read and more accessible.

I would also like to turn this page into a React project, as well as keeping it updated. I will be adding more projects from the collective in the future and improving the user experience.

### Usage
Please let me know if you would like to use this project as a template to create your personal project. I'll be happy to get in touch and help with whatever you need.
