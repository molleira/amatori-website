      Collaborating is one of our core values, spiced up with friendship, sharing and fun. Amatori is all about
      this — enjoying the journey together.
    </h1>

    <p class="bio-desc bio-par">
      Amatori is a Berlin-based collective and record label that celebrates the art of the amateur. Named after
      the
      Italian word for 'amateurs,' Amatori consists of international people who share their passion for music and
      creativity.
    </p>

    <p class="bio-par">
      The core members of Amatori are based between Berlin and Bassano del Grappa in Italy. While they work
      full-time in areas beyond music, they use Amatori as a soundboard to bounce ideas, explore music production
      techniques, and most importantly, enjoy the process.
    </p>

    <p class="bio-par">
      As a collective, the group encourages exchanging knowledge in a safe space, whether that space is a living
      room, video call, stream or DIY party location. Since 2019, the community has ebbed and flowed, welcoming
      friends and mutual friends from abroad into the fold. Together they build a network to boost each other's
      projects. B2B DJ sets, mixing and mastering one another's tracks, providing feedback and sharing music is
      standard within the group. Supporting and encouraging creativity in any shape—as well as being supported by
      and in constant dialogue with other arts—is vital to the collective.
    </p>

    <p class="bio-par">
      The aesthetic of Amatori has oscillated between down-tempo, layer-textured melodies like the Recel EP to
      percussive-heavy, dark atmospheres in Lub~Dub. Every month, the collective invites intriguing DJs to
      contribute to Amatori's multi-toned Amamix archive. Building a diverse sound palette is integral to Amatori,
      with a policy that welcomes any genre. So far, five releases make up the label's back catalogue, with plenty
      more in the pipeline by local and international producers.
